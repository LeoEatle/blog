they're accusing, like always without knowing

what is just **fiction** or what is the **truth**

they have no mission, they have no **passion**

but they dare to tell us what's **bad** and what's **good**!
---

stand up, join us, modern crusaders alive

we have the **power** who'll face the **future**

cause we are the **fighters**

just **fighting** for our **fight**!
