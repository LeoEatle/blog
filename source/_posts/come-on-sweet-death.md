i know. i know i've let you down.
i've been a fool to myself.
i thought that i could live for no one else.
but now through all the hurt and pain
it's time for me to respect.
The one you love mean more than anything
so with sadness in my heart
feel the best thing I could do
it's end it all and leave forever

what's done is done it feels so bad
what is happiness now is sad
i'll never love again my world is ending

i wish that i could turn back time
cause now the guilty is all mine
can't live without the trust you love
i know we can't forget the past
you can't forget love and pride
because of that, it's killing me inside

it all returns to nothing
it all comes tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down
it all returns to nothing
i just keep letting me down letting me down letting me down

in my heart of hearts
i know i can't love again
i lost everything
everything
everything that matters to me matters to this world


ah ah ah ah tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down
ah ah ah ah letting me down letting me down letting me down
