# Purpose

Purpose确实要比target或者goal都要来的好的一个词，因为它代表的不是说你的目标或者要达成的目的，而是你的意愿，也许它不会最后达成，但是这并不关键，关键是这代表了你的态度。也许这就是一种注重过程而不是结果的一个好词。

[Spoken:]
I don't know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it's wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions

You can't be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that's not who you are. You know you're trying to be the best you can be, but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening

That's what happening with me, it's like "God, I'm giving it all I've got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm going to do it." And it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding that's how it is
